## **Project 1 - Impacts of Transport and Heating Electrification on Great Britain’s Power Demand and Market Dynamics**

In 2024, the UK’s total electricity demand amounted to 319 TWh, which represents a 0.5% increase compared to 2023. In 2025, two key structural transitions are expected to push the country’s demand even higher: namely the electrification of vehicles as well as the transition of residential heating from gas to electricity-based systems. The percentage of EVs in the UK’s car parc has been linearly increasing since 2021, from 1% to an estimated 5% in 2025. Regarding residential heating, the UK has announced its goal to reach full decarbonization of domestic heating by 2050 (“Heat Pump Ready” Program). According to a UK census conducted in 2025, 77% of households are still using gas-based or oil-based heating systems. These shifts will not only increase overall demand in the upcoming years, but also directly affect the demand patterns and therefore impact the electricity markets, pricing, volatility, and trading dynamics.
