## **Project 8 - Vasicek Short-Rate Monte Carlo**

Monte Carlo simulation of the Vasicek short-rate model for zero-coupon bond pricing.

Simulates stochastic short-rate paths via Eulerâ€“Maruyama discretization.

Prices a bond as the expected discounted payoff.

Demonstrates interest-rate modeling and stochastic integration.
