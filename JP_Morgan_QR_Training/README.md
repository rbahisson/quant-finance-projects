# JP Morgan Quantitative Research Training 

This training was focused on developping both contract pricing models and credit risk models, under the supervision of Senior JP Morgan Quant Researchers. 

## **Commodity Storage Contract Pricing Model**
Developed a natural gas storage pricing model combining time-series price forecasting with seasonality, inventory constraints, and cash-flow valuation to estimate contract value across injection and withdrawal schedules.

## **Credit Risk & FICO Bucketing Model**
Built a credit risk framework to estimate probability of default and expected loss using borrower-level financial data, and designed a data-driven FICO score bucketing methodology to summarize and compare credit quality.
