# **Stochastic Models and Derivatives**

## Basket Option Monte Carlo Simulation (*C++*)
Extends the Monte Carlo framework to two correlated assets to price a basket call option.
It demonstrates correlation modeling through Cholesky decomposition and multi-asset option valuation techniques.

## European Call Monte Carlo Simulation (*C++*)
Monte-Carlo simulation for pricing a European Call Option under the Black-Scholes model. 
Illustrates stochastic simulation, discounted payoff estimation, and random number generation via the Box–Muller algorithm.

## FX European Call Finite Difference Method (*C++*)
Implements an explicit finite-difference scheme to solve the Black–Scholes PDE for a foreign-exchange call option. 
The project highlights numerical methods, grid stability, and the treatment of domestic and foreign interest rates.

## Vasicek Short-Rate Monte Carlo Simulation (*C++*)
Simulates the Vasicek short-rate process using Euler–Maruyama discretization to price a zero-coupon bond. 
It showcases stochastic interest-rate modeling and the estimation of expected discount factors via Monte Carlo simulation.

## Volatily Modeling (*ARCH, GARCH, EMWA*)
Modeling financial market volatility using ARCH, GARCH, and EWMA frameworks.
Compares volatility persistence and clustering effects for JPMorgan Chase daily returns.
