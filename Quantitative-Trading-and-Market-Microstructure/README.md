# **Quantitative Trading and Market Microstructure**

## Market-Making and Risk Visualization Simulation
Developed a Python-based market-making simulator to model bid/offer pricing, trade execution, and cumulative nominal risk visualization. 
Implemented dynamic position tracking and data validation to analyze trading performance and visualize exposure evolution over time.

## Time-Series Momentum Backtesting 
Built a backtest to study time-series momentum and its risk-return trade-offs. 
This simulation shows that short-horizon momentum acts as a risk-management overlay rather than a return-enhancing signal.
