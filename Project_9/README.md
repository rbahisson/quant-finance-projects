## **Project 9 - Market Making & Risk Visualization Simulation**

This project implements a simplified **Market Maker simulation** designed to emulate basic trading dynamics, quoting strategies, and position tracking over time. It was developed as part of a quantitative finance learning initiative to understand trade execution, bid/offer pricing, and risk accumulation.

- Simulates trading behavior between a market maker and counterparties.  
- Tracks *quoted*, *executed*, and *hedged* trades dynamically.  
- Visualizes:
  - Bid, offer, and reference price evolution over time  
  - Cumulative nominal risk exposure  
  - Daily returns and position adjustments
