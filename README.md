# Quantitative Finance Projects

End-to-end quantitative finance portfolio demonstrating skills in financial modeling, risk analysis, and data-driven investment research.

## **Project 1 – Investment Analysis for Equity Portfolio**
Analysis of U.S. financial institutions’ stock performance using historical price data.  
Includes computation of simple and log returns, portfolio construction, and risk–return evaluation.

## **Project 2 – Linear Regression and Regularization Techniques**
Implementation and comparison of OLS, Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression models.  
Demonstrates the impact of regularization on bias–variance tradeoffs in predictive modeling.

## **Project 3 – Stock Price Prediction of Bank of America Using Machine Learning and Macroeconomic Indicators**
Application of multiple regression-based ML models to predict BAC stock prices.  
Integrates market and macroeconomic indicators such as VIX, Treasury yields, oil, and gold.

## **Project 4 – Volatility Modeling Using Quantitative Models**
Modeling financial market volatility using *ARCH*, *GARCH*, and *EWMA* frameworks.  
Compares volatility persistence and clustering effects for JPMorgan Chase daily returns.

## **Project 5 - Monte Carlo Simulation Call (*C++*)**
Monte-Carlo simulation for pricing a European Call Option under the Black-Scholes model.
Illustrates stochastic simulation, discounted payoff estimation, and random number generation via the Box–Muller algorithm.

## **Project 6 - Monte Carlo Basket Option (*C++*)**
Extends the Monte Carlo framework to two correlated assets to price a basket call option.
It demonstrates correlation modeling through Cholesky decomposition and multi-asset option valuation techniques.

## **Project 7 - Finite Difference FX European Call (*C++*)**
Implements an explicit finite-difference scheme to solve the Black–Scholes PDE for a foreign-exchange call option.
The project highlights numerical methods, grid stability, and the treatment of domestic and foreign interest rates.

## **Project 8 - Vasicek Short-Rate Monte Carlo (*C++*)**
Simulates the Vasicek short-rate process using Euler–Maruyama discretization to price a zero-coupon bond.
It showcases stochastic interest-rate modeling and the estimation of expected discount factors via Monte Carlo simulation.

## **Project 9 - Market Making & Risk Visualization Simulation**
Developed a Python-based market-making simulator to model bid/offer pricing, trade execution, and cumulative nominal risk visualization.
Implemented dynamic position tracking and data validation to analyze trading performance and visualize exposure evolution over time.

## **Project 10 - Total Portfolio Risk Analysis**
Allows user to build their own portfolio with both European and American options (long and short). 
Then analyzes the entire portfolio's risk profile in real-time. 

## **Project 11 - Evaluation of a Certificate**
Evaluation of a Certificate from Commerzbank. 
Computed the Value of the Index, its volatility as well as the Certificate's Fair Price. 

## **Project 12 - Performance Evaluation of a Fund**
Calculated the annualized return rate, standard deviation and maximum 4-week drawdown. 
Compared its performance with various benchmarks by computing the Sharpe ratio and Information ratio. 

# **Poker Assistant (Monte Carlo Betting Advisor)**
Python-based decision assistant for Texas Hold’em using *Monte Carlo simulations*.  
Estimates win probabilities, computes pot odds, and recommends betting actions based on risk preferences.
